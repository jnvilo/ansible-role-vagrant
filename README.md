Installs Vagrant 

## What is Vagrant

Vagrant is an open-source tool that simplifies the management of virtualized development environments. By providing a command-line interface and configuration files, Vagrant allows developers to define, create, and manage reproducible virtual machines (VMs) or containers for their projects. Vagrant abstracts the complexities of setting up and configuring development environments by automating the provisioning process. It supports various virtualization providers, such as VirtualBox, VMware, and Docker, enabling consistent environments across different platforms. With Vagrant, developers can effortlessly create isolated sandboxes, ensuring consistency between team members and making it easier to share and collaborate on projects while minimizing configuration-related issues.

## What do we use it for

Vagrant is employed to test Ansible roles effectively. In each Ansible role directory, there should exist a corresponding Vagrant directory containing the essential files: Vagrantfile, playbook.yml, and ansible.cfg. Within the ansible.cfg file, the roles directory should be pointed to as ../../, and the complete role name should be utilized as a reference.
